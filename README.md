# DataStore Preferences
- This is a learning project
 
## Just an app for me to learn DataStore Preferences concepts

- Updating the 3 Text Fields and Saving
  - updates the preferences for them
- Clicking Favorite Icon 
  - will update it preference
  - and reset all 3 text fields


## Please comment if you see I am doing something wrong, or have a better way of doing it
